   abstract = {Background: It is long known within the mathematical literature that the coefficient of determination R2is an inadequate measure for the goodness of fit in nonlinear models. Nevertheless, it is still frequently used within pharmacological and biochemical literature for the analysis and interpretation of nonlinear fitting to data.Results: The intensive simulation approach undermines previous observations and emphasizes the extremely low performance of R2as a basis for model validity and performance when applied to pharmacological/biochemical nonlinear data. In fact, with the 'true' model having up to 500 times more strength of evidence based on Akaike weights, this was only reflected in the third to fifth decimal place of R2. In addition, even the bias-corrected R2adjexhibited an extreme bias to higher parametrized models. The bias-corrected AICc and also BIC performed significantly better in this respect.Conclusion: Researchers and reviewers should be aware that R2is inappropriate when used for demonstrating the performance or validity of a certain nonlinear model. It should ideally be removed from scientific literature dealing with nonlinear model fitting or at least be supplemented with other methods such as AIC or BIC or used in context to other models in question. © 2010 Spiess and Neumeyer; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

  abstract  = {Modern cancer immunotherapy has revolutionised oncology and carries the potential to radically change the approach to cancer treatment. However, numerous questions remain to be answered to understand immunotherapy response better and further improve the benefit for future cancer patients. Computational models are promising tools that can contribute to accelerated immunotherapy research by providing new clues and hypotheses that could be tested in future trials, based on preceding simulations in addition to the empirical rationale. In this topical review, we briefly summarise the history of cancer immunotherapy, including computational modelling of traditional cancer immunotherapy, and comprehensively review computational models of modern cancer immunotherapy, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (as monotherapy and combination treatment), co-stimulatory agonistic antibodies, bispecific antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor T cells. The modelling approaches are classified into one of the following categories: data-driven top-down vs mechanistic bottom-up, simplistic vs detailed, continuous vs discrete, and hybrid. Several common modelling approaches are summarised, such as pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models, Lotka-Volterra models, evolutionary game theory models, quantitative systems pharmacology models, spatio-temporal models, agent-based models, and logic-based models. Pros and cons of each modelling approach are critically discussed, particularly with the focus on the potential for successful translation into immuno-oncology research and routine clinical practice. Specific attention is paid to calibration and validation of each model, which is a necessary prerequisite for any successful model, and at the same time, one of the main obstacles. Lastly, we provide guidelines and suggestions for the future development of the field.},

   abstract = {In this article, we will trace the historical development of tumor growth laws, which in a quantitative fashion describe the increase in tumor mass/volume over time. These models are usually formulated in terms of differential equations that relate the growth rate of the tumor to its current state and range from the simple one-parameter exponential growth model to more advanced models that contain a large number of parameters. Understanding the assumptions and consequences of such models is important, as they often underpin more complex models of tumor growth. The conclusion of this brief survey is that although much improvement has occurred over the last century, more effort and new models are required if we are to understand the intricacies of tumor growth.

  abstract  = {Despite internal complexity, tumor growth kinetics follow relatively simple laws that can be expressed as mathematical models. To explore this further, quantitative analysis of the most classical of these were performed. The models were assessed against data from two in vivo experimental systems: an ectopic syngeneic tumor (Lewis lung carcinoma) and an orthotopically xenografted human breast carcinoma. The goals were threefold: 1) to determine a statistical model for description of the measurement error, 2) to establish the descriptive power of each model, using several goodness-of-fit metrics and a study of parametric identifiability, and 3) to assess the models' ability to forecast future tumor growth. The models included in the study comprised the exponential, exponential-linear, power law, Gompertz, logistic, generalized logistic, von Bertalanffy and a model with dynamic carrying capacity. For the breast data, the dynamics were best captured by the Gompertz and exponential-linear models. The latter also exhibited the highest predictive power, with excellent prediction scores (≥80%) extending out as far as 12 days in the future. For the lung data, the Gompertz and power law models provided the most parsimonious and parametrically identifiable description. However, not one of the models was able to achieve a substantial prediction rate (≥70%) beyond the next day data point. In this context, adjunction of a priori information on the parameter distribution led to considerable improvement. For instance, forecast success rates went from 14.9% to 62.7% when using the power law model to predict the full future tumor growth curves, using just three data points. These results not only have important implications for biological theories of tumor growth and the use of mathematical modeling in preclinical anti-cancer drug investigations, but also may assist in defining how mathematical models could serve as potential prognostic tools in the clinic.},

In this work, we rigorously explore how to balance these competing interests when modeling murine melanoma treatment with oncolytic viruses and dendritic cell injections. Previously, we developed a system of six ordinary differential equations containing fourteen parameters that well describes experimental data on the efficacy of these treatments. Here, we explore whether this previously developed model is the minimal model needed to accurately describe the data. Using a variety of techniques, including sensitivity analyses and a parameter sloppiness analysis, we find that our model can be reduced by one variable and three parameters and still give excellent fits to the data. We also argue that our model is not too simple to capture the dynamics of the data, and that the original and minimal models make similar predictions about the efficacy and robustness of protocols not considered in experiments. Reducing the model to its minimal form allows us to increase the tractability of the system in the face of parametric uncertainty.},

Advances in cancer-immune modeling that describe complex interactions underlying the ability of the immune system to both promote and inhibit tumor growth are emphasized.

This functional response largely determines dynamic stability, responses to environmental influences and the nature of indirect effects in the food web containing the predator- prey pair. Nevertheless, measurements of functional responses in nature are quite rare. Recently, much work has been devoted to comparing two idealized forms of the functional response: prey dependent and ratio dependent. Although we agree that predator abundance often affects the consumption rate of individual predators, this phenomenon requires more attention. Disagreement remains over which of the two idealized responses serves as a better starting point in building models when data on predator dependence are absent.},

Their paper, while contains many new and significant results, is far from complete in answering the many subtle mathematical questions on the global qualitative behavior of solutions of the model. Indeed, many of such important open questions are mentioned in the discussion section of their paper. Through a simple change of variable, we transform the Michaelis-Menten-type ratio-dependent model to a better studied Gause-type predator-prey system. As a result, we can obtain a complete classification of the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of the Michaelis-Menten-type ratio-dependent model. In some cases we can determine how the outcomes depend on the initial conditions. In particular, open questions on the global stability of all equilibria in various cases and the uniqueness of limit cycles are resolved. Biological implications of our results are also presented.},

   abstract = {Recently, increasing data show that immunotherapy could be a powerful weapon against cancers. Comparing to the traditional surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy, immunotherapy more specifically targets cancer cells, giving rise to the opportunities to the patients to have higher response rates and better quality of life and even to cure the disease. Cancer vaccines could be designed to target tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), cancer germline antigens, virus-associated antigens, or tumor-specific antigens (TSAs), which are also called neoantigens. The cancer vaccines could be cell-based (e.g., dendritic cell vaccine provenge (sipuleucel-T) targeting prostatic acid phosphatase for metastatic prostate cancer), peptide/protein-based, or gene- (DNA/RNA) based, with the different kinds of adjuvants. Neoantigens are tumor-specific and could be presented by MHC molecules and recognized by T lymphocytes, serving the ideal immune targets to increase the therapeutic specificity and decrease the risk of nonspecific autoimmunity. By targeting the shared antigens and private epitopes, the cancer vaccine has potential to treat the disease. Accordingly, personalized neoantigen-based immunotherapies are emerging. In this article, we review the literature and evidence of the advantage and application of cancer vaccine. We summarize the recent clinical trials of neoantigen cancer vaccines which were designed according to the patients’ personal mutanome. With the rapid development of personalized immunotherapy, it is believed that tumors could be efficiently controlled and become curable in the new era of precision medicine.},

Neoantigens are highly immunogenic as they are not expressed in normal tissues. They can activate CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to generate immune response and have the potential to become new targets of tumor immunotherapy. The development of bioinformatics technology has accelerated the identification of neoantigens. The combination of different algorithms to identify and predict the affinity of neoantigens to major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) or the immunogenicity of neoantigens is mainly based on the whole-exome sequencing technology. Tumor vaccines targeting neoantigens mainly include nucleic acid, dendritic cell (DC)-based, tumor cell, and synthetic long peptide (SLP) vaccines. The combination with immune checkpoint inhibition therapy or radiotherapy and chemotherapy might achieve better therapeutic effects. Currently, several clinical trials have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of these vaccines. Further development of sequencing technologies and bioinformatics algorithms, as well as an improvement in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying tumor development, will expand the application of neoantigen vaccines in the future.},

  abstract  = {A fundamental step in synthetic biology and systems biology is to derive appropriate mathematical models for the purposes of analysis and design. For example, to synthesize a gene regulatory network, the derivation of a mathematical model is important in order to carry out in silico investigations of the network dynamics and to investigate parameter variations and robustness issues. Different mathematical frameworks have been proposed to derive such models. In particular, the use of sets of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) has been proposed to model the dynamics of the concentrations of mRNAs and proteins. These models are usually characterized by the presence of highly nonlinear Hill function terms. A typical simplification is to reduce the number of equations by means of a quasi-steady-state assumption on the mRNA concentrations. This yields a class of simplified ODE models. A radically different approach is to replace the Hill functions by piecewise-linear approximations [Casey, R., de Jong, H., Gouzover(e, ́), J.-L., 2006. Piecewise-linear models of genetic regulatory networks: equilibria and their stability. J. Math. Biol. 52 (1), 27-56]. A further modelling approach is the use of discrete-time maps [Coutinho, R., Fernandez, B., Lima, R., Meyroneinc, A., 2006. Discrete time piecewise affine models of genetic regulatory networks. J. Math. Biol. 52, 524-570] where the evolution of the system is modelled in discrete, rather than continuous, time. The aim of this paper is to discuss and compare these different modelling approaches, using a representative gene regulatory network. We will show that different models often lead to conflicting conclusions concerning the existence and stability of equilibria and stable oscillatory behaviours. Moreover, we shall discuss, where possible, the viability of making certain modelling approximations (e.g. quasi-steady-state mRNA dynamics or piecewise-linear approximations of Hill functions) and their effects on the overall system dynamics. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {This paper presents a mathematical framework for describing and analysing gene regulatory networks by autonomous differential equations. It represents an improvement on existing frameworks in that it may handle a wider range of gene regulatory mechanisms. Gene regulatory networks are frequently threshold-dominated, i.e. genes are activated only when the concentration of certain gene products lie between definite thresholds. Here, the concept of regulatory domain is introduced to describe these regions in the phase space. To each regulatory domain is associated an indicator function whose value is 1 inside and 0 outside the domain. The indicator functions thus reflect the logical structure of the network. The sharp borders between the regulatory domains may be smoothed by replacing the logical step functions by continuous sigmoids or so-called logoid functions. A logoid function coincides with the step function outside a narrow interval around the threshold, and rises continuously from 0 to 1 inside it. Using logoids, the task of finding steady states is considerably simplified. A list of regions in phase space comprising all steady states lying close to a threshold is obtained by examining a certain type of matrix called the Logoid-Jacobian. In addition, this matrix leads to the conditions necessary for stability of the steady states. External signals may be conveniently incorporated in the form of Boolean variables. Thus the framework is well suited for studying gene regulatory networks both in single cells and multicellular systems. © 1995 Academic Press Limited.},

  abstract  = {A new approach to the analysis of tumor growth curves was formulated, programmed for a digital computer, and subjected to extensive use and statistical evaluation. The method is based on the following differential equation: Where dV/dt is growth rate, V is volume, k is a growth constant, and the exponent b defines the mode of growth (linear, exponential, cube-root, etc.). Serial caliper measurements of three tumor dimensions were recorded on punch cards, and an IBM 7040 computer calculated the volumes. An optimum growth curve was fit to the data by an iterative procedure which selected the best value of b based on a test of the linearity of regression. Estimates and standard deviations were generated for such growth parameters as smoothed volume, growth rate, extrapolated volume, and mode of growth. The resolution and reliability of the method are described in terms of the quantity, quality, and duration of measurements. Application of the method to several hundred C3H mouse mammary tumors indicated that the average mode of growth was close to the cube-root mode. Small tumors tended toward exponential growth; but the modes of growth were widely distributed in each of the subpopulations studied, and the mode of growth could not be estimated a priori. Extrapolation demonstrated limited reliability, but only when based on well-founded growth curves and when not extended far beyond the measured data. © 1968, Oxford University Press.},

We present a new mathematical model that describes tumor-immune interactions, focusing on the role of natural killer (NK) and CD8+ T cells in tumor surveillance, with the goal of understanding the dynamics of immune-mediated tumor rejection. The model describes tumor-immune cell interactions using a system of differential equations. The functions describing tumor-immune growth, response, and interaction rates, as well as associated variables, are developed using a least-squares method combined with a numerical differential equations solver. Parameter estimates and model validations use data from published mouse and human studies. Specifically, CD8+ T-tumor and NK-tumor lysis data from chromium release assays as well as in vivo tumor growth data are used. A variable sensitivity analysis is done on the model. The new functional forms developed show that there is a clear distinction between the dynamics of NK and CD8+ T cells. Simulations of tumor growth using different levels of immune stimulating ligands, effector cells, and tumor challenge are able to reproduce data from the published studies. A sensitivity analysis reveals that the variable to which the model is most sensitive is patient specific, and can be measured with a chromium release assay. The variable sensitivity analysis suggests that the model can predict which patients may positively respond to treatment.

Because tumor cells begin as ‘self’, the immune system may not respond in an effective way to eradicate them. Adoptive cellular immunotherapy can potentially restore or enhance these effects. We illustrate through mathematical modeling the dynamics between tumor cells, immune-effector cells, and IL-2. These efforts are able to explain both short tumor oscillations in tumor sizes as well as long-term tumor relapse.

  abstract  = {Cancer therapies that harness the actions of the immune response, such as targeted monoclonal antibody treatments and therapeutic vaccines, are relatively new and promising in the landscape of cancer treatment options. Mathematical modeling and simulation of immune-modifying therapies can help to offset the costs of drug discovery and development, and encourage progress toward new immunotherapies. Despite advances in cancer immunology research, questions such as how the immune system interacts with a growing tumor, and which components of the immune system play significant roles in responding to immunotherapy are still not well understood. Mathematical modeling and simulation are powerful tools that provide an analytical framework in which to address such questions. A quantitative understanding of the kinetics of the immune response to treatment is crucial in designing treatment strategies, such as dosing, timing, and predicting the response to a specific treatment. These models can be used both descriptively and predictively. In this chapter, various mathematical models that address different cancer treatments, including cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and combinations of both treatments, are presented. The aim of this chapter is to highlight the importance of mathematical modeling and simulation in the design of immunotherapy protocols for cancer treatment. The results demonstrate the power of these approaches in explaining determinants that are fundamental to cancer-immune dynamics, therapeutic success, and the development of efficient therapies.},

This succinct review offers an overview of recent tumor-immune continuum modeling approaches, highlighting spatial models.

Due to their relevance to cancer, the following immune cells and their combinations are described: macrophages, Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes, Natural Killer cells, dendritic cells, T regulatory cells, and CD4+ T helper cells.

In this regard, the main aims are: (i) to introduce a single-objective optimization problem and to design the considered metaheuristics in order to appropriately deal with it; (ii) to use the PMP in order to obtain the necessary conditions for optimality, i.e. the governing boundary value problem; (iii) to measure the results obtained by using the proposed metaheuristics against those results obtained by using an indirect approach called forward-backward sweep method; and finally (iv) to produce a set of optimal treatment strategies by formulating the problem in a bi-objective form and demonstrating its advantages over single-objective optimization problem.

  abstract  = {Recent experimental evidence suggests that vasculogenesis may play an important role in tumour vascularisation. While angiogenesis involves the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells (ECs) in pre-existing vessels, vasculogenesis involves the mobilisation of bone-marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) into the bloodstream. Once blood-borne, EPCs home in on the tumour site, where subsequently they may differentiate into ECs and form vascular structures. In this paper, we develop a mathematical model, formulated as a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which describes vascular tumour growth with both angiogenesis and vasculogenesis contributing to vessel formation. Submodels describing exclusively angiogenic and exclusively vasculogenic tumours are shown to exhibit similar growth dynamics. In each case, there are three possible scenarios: the tumour remains in an avascular steady state, the tumour evolves to a vascular equilibrium, or unbounded vascular growth occurs. Analysis of the full model reveals that these three behaviours persist when angiogenesis and vasculogenesis act simultaneously. However, when both vascularisation mechanisms are active, the tumour growth rate may increase, causing the tumour to evolve to a larger equilibrium size or to expand uncontrollably. Alternatively, the growth rate may be left unaffected, which occurs if either vascularisation process alone is able to keep pace with the demands of the growing tumour. To clarify further the effects of vasculogenesis, the full model is also used to compare possible treatment strategies, including chemotherapy and antiangiogenic therapies aimed at suppressing vascularisation. This investigation highlights how, dependent on model parameter values, targeting both ECs and EPCs may be necessary in order to effectively reduce tumour vasculature and inhibit tumour growth.},

  abstract  = {A class of piecewise affine differential (PWA) models, initially proposed by Glass and Kauffman (in J Theor Biol 39:103–129, 1973), has been widely used for the modelling and the analysis of biological switch-like systems, such as genetic or neural networks. Its mathematical tractability facilitates the qualitative analysis of dynamical behaviors, in particular periodic phenomena which are of prime importance in biology. Notably, a discrete qualitative description of the dynamics, called the transition graph, can be directly associated to this class of PWA systems. Here we present a study of periodic behaviours (i.e. limit cycles) in a class of two-dimensional piecewise affine biological models. Using concavity and continuity properties of Poincaré maps, we derive structural principles linking the topology of the transition graph to the existence, number and stability of limit cycles. These results notably extend previous works on the investigation of structural principles to the case of unequal and regulated decay rates for the 2-dimensional case. Some numerical examples corresponding to minimal models of biological oscillators are treated to illustrate the use of these structural principles.},

These interactions are driven either by changes in animal abundance (density-mediated interactions, e.g., apparent competition), or by changes in animal preferences for plants (behaviorally-mediated interactions). This article studies effects of behaviorally-mediated interactions on two plant population dynamics and animal preference dynamics when animal densities are fixed. Animals can be either adaptive exploiters or adaptive mutualists (e.g., herbivores or pollinators) that maximize their fitness. Analysis of the model shows that adaptive animal preferences for plants can lead to multiple outcomes of plant coexistence with different levels of specialization or generalism for the mediator animal species. In particular, exploiter generalism promotes plant coexistence even when inter-specific competition is too strong to make plant coexistence possible without exploiters, and mutualist specialization promotes plant coexistence at alternative stable states when plant inter-specific competition is weak. Introducing a new concept of generalized isoclines allows us to fully analyze the model with respect to the strength of competitive interactions between plants (weak or strong), and the type of interaction between plants and animals (exploitation or mutualism).},

We synthetically consider both the number of infected population and its changing rate as the switching condition to implement the curing measures. By using the properties of the Lambert W function, we convert the proposed switching condition to a threshold value related to the susceptible population. The classical epidemic model involving media coverage, linear functions describing injecting vaccine and treatment strategies is examined when the susceptible population exceeds the threshold value. In addition, we consider another SIR model accompanied with the vaccination and treatment strategies represented by saturation functions when the susceptible population is smaller than the threshold value. The dynamics of these two subsystems and the sliding domain are discussed in detail. Four types of local sliding bifurcation are investigated, including boundary focus, boundary node, boundary saddle and boundary saddle-node bifurcations. In the meantime, the global bifurcation involving the appearance of limit cycles is examined, including touching bifurcation, homoclinic bifurcation to the pseudo-saddle and crossing bifurcation. Furthermore, the influence of some key parameters related to the three treatment strategies is explored. We also validate our model by the epidemic data sets of A/H1N1 and COVID-19, which can be employed to reveal the effects of media report and existing strategy related to the control of emerging infectious diseases on the variations of confirmed cases.},

  abstract  = {In a mathematical model of the cellular immune response we investigate immune reactions to tumors that are introduced in various doses. The model represents macrophage T-lymphocyte interactions that generate cytotoxic macrophages and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. In this model antigens (tumors) can induce infinitely large T-lymphocyte effector populations because (a) effector T-lymphocytes are capable of repeated proliferation and (b) we have omitted immunosuppression. In this (proliferative) model small doses of weakly antigenic tumors grow infinitely large (i.e. sneak through) eliciting an immune response of limited magnitude. Intermediate doses of the same tumor induce larger immune responses and are hence rejected. Large doses of the tumor break through, but their progressive growth is accompanied by a strong immune response involving extensive lymphocyte proliferation. Similarly a more antigenic tumor is rejected in intermediate doses and breaks through in large doses. Initially small doses however lead to tumor dormancy. Thus although the model is devoid of explicit regulatory mechanisms that limit the magnitude of its response (immunosuppression is such a mechanism), the immune response to large increasing tumors may either be (a) a stable reaction of limited magnitude (experimentally known as tolerance or unresponsiveness) or (b) a strong and ever increasing reaction. Unresponsiveness can evolve because in this model net T-lymphocyte proliferation requires the presence of a minimum number of helper T cells (i.e. a proliferation threshold). Unresponsiveness is caused by depletion of helper T cell precursors. © 1986 Academic Press Inc. (London) Ltd.},

  abstract  = {While biological controls have been successfully and frequently implemented by nature and human, plausible mathematical models are yet to be found to explain the often observed deterministic extinctions of both pest and control agent in such processes. In this paper we study a three trophic level food chain model with ratio-dependent Michaelis-Menten type functional responses. We shall show that this model is rich in boundary dynamics and is capable of generating such extinction dynamics. Two trophic level Michaelis-Menten type ratio-dependent predator-prey system was globally and systematically analyzed in details recently. A distinct and realistic feature of ratio-dependence is its capability of producing the extinction of prey species, and hence the collapse of the system. Another distinctive feature of this model is that its dynamical outcomes may depend on initial populations levels. Theses features, if preserved in a three trophic food chain model, make it appealing for modelling certain biological control processes (where prey is a plant species, middle predator as a pest, and top predator as a biological control agent) where the simultaneous extinctions of pest and control agent is the hallmark of their successes and are usually dependent on the amount of control agent. Our results indicate that this extinction dynamics and sensitivity to initial population levels are not only preserved, but also enriched in the three trophic level food chain model. Specifically, we provide partial answers to questions such as: under what scenarios a potential biological control may be successful, and when it may fail. We also study the questions such as what conditions ensure the coexistence of all the three species in the forms of a stable steady state and limit cycle, respectively. A multiple attractor scenario is found. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

Seven ordinary differential equation (ODE) models of tumor growth (exponential, Mendelsohn, logistic, linear, surface, Gompertz, and Bertalanffy) have been proposed, but there is no clear guidance on how to choose the most appropriate model for a particular cancer. Methods: We examined all seven of the previously proposed ODE models in the presence and absence of chemotherapy. We derived equations for the maximum tumor size, doubling time, and the minimum amount of chemotherapy needed to suppress the tumor and used a sample data set to compare how these quantities differ based on choice of growth model. Results: We find that there is a 12-fold difference in predicting doubling times and a 6-fold difference in the predicted amount of chemotherapy needed for suppression depending on which growth model was used. Conclusion: Our results highlight the need for careful consideration of model assumptions when developing mathematical models for use in cancer treatment planning.},

  abstract  = {It is now well-established that the host's adaptive immune system plays an important role in identifying and eliminating cancer cells in much the same way that intracellular pathogens are cleared during an adaptive immune response to infection. From a therapeutic standpoint, the adaptive immune system is unique in that it can co-evolve alongside a developing tumor. Tumor acquisition of immune evasive phenotypes, such as class-I MHC down-regulation, remains a major limitation of successful T-cell immunotherapy. Here, we consider a population dynamical model coupling tumor and adaptive immune compartments in order to study the dynamics and survival of an evolving threat when faced with adaptive immune pressure. We demonstrate that predicted optimal growth strategies depend on whether or not the threat may acquire an immune-evasive phenotype as well as the mode of immune detection. We parameterize adaptive immune functioning by T-cell turnover and repertoire diversity and predict that decreases in the latter quantity which occur in advanced age may substantially affect the ability to recognize, and therefore control, an immune evasive threat like cancer. This framework recapitulates general features of age-dependent AML incidence, thereby providing a probable association between cancer frequency and adaptive immune functioning. Lastly, we quantify therapeutic efficacy of adjuvant immunotherapeutic strategies, and predict their benefits and limitations with regard to handling immune evasion. Our model generates survival behavior consistent with known growth-dependent characteristics, and serves as a first attempt at modeling stochastic cancer evolution alongside an adaptive immune compartment.},

Multiple successful clinical applications of cancer vaccines have shown good safety and efficacy. Despite the notable progress, significant challenges remain in obtaining consistent immune responses across heterogeneous patient populations, as well as various cancers. We present a mechanistic mathematical model describing key interactions of a personalized neoantigen cancer vaccine with an individual patient’s immune system. Specifically, the model considers the vaccine concentration of tumor-specific antigen peptides and adjuvant, the patient’s major histocompatibility complexes I and II copy numbers, tumor size, T cells, and antigen presenting cells. We parametrized the model using patient-specific data from a clinical study in which individualized cancer vaccines were used to treat six melanoma patients. Model simulations predicted both immune responses, represented by T cell counts, to the vaccine as well as clinical outcome (determined as change of tumor size). This model, although complex, can be used to describe, simulate, and predict the behavior of the human immune system to a personalized cancer vaccine.},

We provide a mathematical analysis of this limit and show that a reduction to a set of piecewise linear ODEs and Boolean networks can be mathematically justified.

This is a four-population model that includes tumor cells, host cells, immune cells, and drug interaction. We analyze the stability of the drug-free equilibria with respect to the immune response in order to look for target basins of attraction. One of our goals was to simulate qualitatively the asynchronous tumor-drug interaction known as "Jeff's phenomenon." The model we develop is successful in generating this asynchronous response behavior. Our other goal was to identify treatment protocols that could improve standard pulsed chemotherapy regimens. Using optimal control theory with constraints and numerical simulations, we obtain new therapy protocols that we then compare with traditional pulsed periodic treatment. The optimal control generated therapies produce larger oscillations in the tumor population over time. However, by the end of the treatment period, total tumor size is smaller than that achieved through traditional pulsed therapy, and the normal cell population suffers nearly no oscillations.},

  abstract  = {Accuracy of results from mathematical and computer models of biological systems is often complicated by the presence of uncertainties in experimental data that are used to estimate parameter values. Current mathematical modeling approaches typically use either single-parameter or local sensitivity analyses. However, these methods do not accurately assess uncertainty and sensitivity in the system as, by default, they hold all other parameters fixed at baseline values. Using techniques described within we demonstrate how a multi-dimensional parameter space can be studied globally so all uncertainties can be identified. Further, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis techniques can help to identify and ultimately control uncertainties. In this work we develop methods for applying existing analytical tools to perform analyses on a variety of mathematical and computer models. We compare two specific types of global sensitivity analysis indexes that have proven to be among the most robust and efficient. Through familiar and new examples of mathematical and computer models, we provide a complete methodology for performing these analyses, in both deterministic and stochastic settings, and propose novel techniques to handle problems encountered during these types of analyses. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract  = {In order to cope with the large amounts of data that have become available in genomics, mathematical tools for the analysis of networks of interactions between genes, proteins, and other molecules are indispensable. We present a method for the qualitative simulation of genetic regulatory networks, based on a class of piecewise-linear (PL) differential equations that has been well-studied in mathematical biology. The simulation method is well-adapted to state-of-the-art measurement techniques in genomics, which often provide qualitative and coarse-grained descriptions of genetic regulatory networks. Given a qualitative model of a genetic regulatory network, consisting of a system of PL differential equations and inequality constraints on the parameter values, the method produces a graph of qualitative states and transitions between qualitative states, summarizing the qualitative dynamics of the system. The qualitative simulation method has been implemented in Java in the computer tool Genetic Network Analyzer. © 2003 Society for Mathematical Biology. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract  = {Dose and time intensifications of chemotherapy improved the outcome of lymphoma therapy. However, recent study results show that too intense therapies can result in inferior tumour control. We hypothesise that the immune system plays a key role in controlling residual tumour cells after treatment. More intense therapies result in a stronger depletion of immune cells allowing an early re-growth of the tumour. We propose a differential equations model of the dynamics and interactions of tumour and immune cells under chemotherapy. Major model features are an exponential tumour growth, a modulation of the production of effector cells by the presence of the tumour (immunogenicity), and mutual destruction of tumour and immune cells. Chemotherapy causes damage to both, immune and tumour cells. Growth rate, chemosensitivity, immunogenicity, and initial size of the tumour are assumed to be patient-specific, resulting in heterogeneity regarding therapy outcome. Maximum-entropy distributions of these parameters were estimated on the basis of clinical survival data. The resulting model can explain the outcome of five different chemotherapeutic regimens and corresponding hazard-ratios. We conclude that our model explains observed paradox effects in lymphoma therapy by the simple assumption of a relevant anti-tumour effect of the immune system. Heterogeneity of therapy outcomes can be explained by distributions of model parameters, which can be estimated on the basis of clinical survival data. We demonstrate how the model can be used to make predictions regarding yet untested therapy options. © 2013 The Author(s).},

This is important in key research areas such as ecology, epidemiology, wound healing and oncology. Despite the well developed theory and techniques for determining single optimal controls, there is limited practical guidance supporting implementation of combination therapies. In this work we use optimal control theory to calculate optimal strategies for applying combination therapies to a model of acute myeloid leukaemia. We present a versatile framework to systematically explore the trade-offs that arise in designing combination therapy protocols using optimal control. We consider various combinations of continuous and bang-bang (discrete) controls, and we investigate how the control dynamics interact and respond to changes in the weighting and form of the pay-off characterising optimality. We demonstrate that the optimal controls respond non-linearly to treatment strength and control parameters, due to the interactions between species. We discuss challenges in appropriately characterising optimality in a multiple control setting and provide practical guidance for applying multiple optimal controls.

  abstract  = {In this paper we consider a combination therapy of cancer. One drug is a vaccine which activates dendritic cells so that they induce more T cells to infiltrate the tumor. The other drug is a checkpoint inhibitor, which enables the T cells to remain active against the cancer cells. The two drugs are positively correlated in the sense that an increase in the amount of each drug results in a reduction in the tumor volume. We consider the question whether a treatment with combination of the two drugs at certain levels is preferable to a treatment by one of the drugs alone at ‘roughly’ twice the dosage level; if that is the case, then we say that there is a positive ‘synergy’ for this combination of dosages. To address this question, we develop a mathematical model using a system of partial differential equations. The variables include dendritic and cancer cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, IL-12 and IL-2, GM-CSF produced by the vaccine, and a T cell checkpoint inhibitor associated with PD-1. We use the model to explore the efficacy of the two drugs, separately and in combination, and compare the simulations with data from mouse experiments. We next introduce the concept of synergy between the drugs and develop a synergy map which suggests in what proportion to administer the drugs in order to achieve the maximum reduction of tumor volume under the constraint of maximum tolerated dose.},

  abstract  = {Somatic mutations in cancer cells can generate tumour-specific neoepitopes, which are recognized by autologous T cells in the host. As neoepitopes are not subject to central immune tolerance and are not expressed in healthy tissues, they are attractive targets for therapeutic cancer vaccines. Because the vast majority of cancer mutations are unique to the individual patient, harnessing the full potential of this rich source of targets requires individualized treatment approaches. Many computational algorithms and machine-learning tools have been developed to identify mutations in sequence data, to prioritize those that are more likely to be recognized by T cells and to design tailored vaccines for every patient. In this Review, we fill the gaps between the understanding of basic mechanisms of T cell recognition of neoantigens and the computational approaches for discovery of somatic mutations and neoantigen prediction for cancer immunotherapy. We present a new classification of neoantigens, distinguishing between guarding, restrained and ignored neoantigens, based on how they confer proficient antitumour immunity in a given clinical context. Such context-based differentiation will contribute to a framework that connects neoantigen biology to the clinical setting and medical peculiarities of cancer, and will enable future neoantigen-based therapies to provide greater clinical benefit. Mutations in cancer cells can generate tumour-specific neoepitopes, which are attractive targets for anticancer vaccines. This Review discusses the mechanisms of neoantigen T cell recognition and computational approaches to predict which neoantigens might confer proficient antitumour immunity in a given clinical context.},

  abstract  = {Understanding resistance to antibody to programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; anti-PD-1) is crucial for the development of reversal strategies. In anti-PD-1-resistant models, simultaneous anti-PD-1 and vaccine therapy reversed resistance, while PD-1 blockade before antigen priming abolished therapeutic outcomes. This was due to induction of dysfunctional PD-1+CD38hi CD8+ cells by PD-1 blockade in suboptimally primed CD8 cell conditions induced by tumors. This results in erroneous T cell receptor signaling and unresponsiveness to antigenic restimulation. On the other hand, PD-1 blockade of optimally primed CD8 cells prevented the induction of dysfunctional CD8 cells, reversing resistance. Depleting PD-1+CD38hi CD8+ cells enhanced therapeutic outcomes. Furthermore, non-responding patients showed more PD-1+CD38+CD8+ cells in tumor and blood than responders. In conclusion, the status of CD8+ T cell priming is a major contributor to anti-PD-1 therapeutic resistance. PD-1 blockade in unprimed or suboptimally primed CD8 cells induces resistance through the induction of PD-1+CD38hi CD8+ cells that is reversed by optimal priming. PD-1+CD38hi CD8+ cells serve as a predictive and therapeutic biomarker for anti-PD-1 treatment. Sequencing of anti-PD-1 and vaccine is crucial for successful therapy. PD-1 blockade can enhance antitumor responses in a subset of cases. Khleif and colleagues demonstrate that PD-1 blockade in the context of suboptimal T cell activation engenders a state of non-responsiveness but not when there is strong stimulation by vaccination.},

Despite extensive experimental work on the causes, development and progression of this disease, much still remains unknown about the importance of the different immunological pathways involved. We present a mathematical model of autoimmune myocarditis and the effects of ICIs on its development and progression to either resolution or chronic inflammation. From this, we gain a better understanding of the role of immune cells, cytokines and other components of the immune system in driving the cardiotoxicity of ICIs. We parameterise the model using existing data from the literature, and show that qualitative model behaviour is consistent with disease characteristics seen in patients in an ICI-free context. The bifurcation structures of the model show how the presence of ICIs increases the risk of developing autoimmune myocarditis. This predictive modelling approach is a first step towards determining treatment regimens that balance the benefits of treating cancer with the risk of developing autoimmune myocarditis.},

Here we demonstrate that a strategy that uses multi-epitope, personalized neoantigen vaccination, which has previously been tested in patients with high-risk melanoma4–6, is feasible for tumours such as glioblastoma, which typically have a relatively low mutation load1,7 and an immunologically ‘cold’ tumour microenvironment8. We used personalized neoantigen-targeting vaccines to immunize patients newly diagnosed with glioblastoma following surgical resection and conventional radiotherapy in a phase I/Ib study. Patients who did not receive dexamethasone—a highly potent corticosteroid that is frequently prescribed to treat cerebral oedema in patients with glioblastoma—generated circulating polyfunctional neoantigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses that were enriched in a memory phenotype and showed an increase in the number of tumour-infiltrating T cells. Using single-cell T cell receptor analysis, we provide evidence that neoantigen-specific T cells from the peripheral blood can migrate into an intracranial glioblastoma tumour. Neoantigen-targeting vaccines thus have the potential to favourably alter the immune milieu of glioblastoma. Neoantigen-targeting vaccines are a feasible therapy for tumours with a low mutation burden and immunologically ‘cold’ tumour microenvironment, as neoantigen-specific T cells from the peripheral blood migrate into intracranial glioblastoma, thereby altering the immune milieu of the glioblastoma.},

  abstract  = {Personal neoantigen vaccines have been envisioned as an effective approach to induce, amplify and diversify antitumor T cell responses. To define the long-term effects of such a vaccine, we evaluated the clinical outcome and circulating immune responses of eight patients with surgically resected stage IIIB/C or IVM1a/b melanoma, at a median of almost 4 years after treatment with NeoVax, a long-peptide vaccine targeting up to 20 personal neoantigens per patient ( NCT01970358 ). All patients were alive and six were without evidence of active disease. We observed long-term persistence of neoantigen-specific T cell responses following vaccination, with ex vivo detection of neoantigen-specific T cells exhibiting a memory phenotype. We also found diversification of neoantigen-specific T cell clones over time, with emergence of multiple T cell receptor clonotypes exhibiting distinct functional avidities. Furthermore, we detected evidence of tumor infiltration by neoantigen-specific T cell clones after vaccination and epitope spreading, suggesting on-target vaccine-induced tumor cell killing. Personal neoantigen peptide vaccines thus induce T cell responses that persist over years and broaden the spectrum of tumor-specific cytotoxicity in patients with melanoma. Personalized neoantigen vaccination in patients with melanoma elicits durable and specific memory T cell clones that have cytotoxic gene signatures and can diversify to include nonvaccine neoantigen specificities.},

  abstract  = {The results of a phase I trial assessing a personal neoantigen multi-peptide vaccine in patients with melanoma, showing feasibility, safety, and immunogenicity. Neoantigens have long been considered optimal targets for anti-tumour vaccines, and recent mutation coding and prediction techniques have aimed to streamline their identification and selection. Two papers in this issue report results from personalized neoantigen vaccine trials in patients with cancer. Catherine Wu and colleagues report the results of a phase I trial of a personalized cancer vaccine that targets up to 20 patient neoantigens. The vaccine was safe and induced tumour-antigen-specific immune responses. Four out of six patients treated showed no recurrence at 25 months, and progressing patients responded to further therapy with checkpoint inhibitor. Ugur Sahin and colleagues report the first-in-human application of a personalized neoantigen vaccine in patients with melanoma. Their vaccination strategy includes sequencing and computational identification of neoantigens from patients, and design and manufacture of a poly-antigen RNA vaccine for treatment. In 13 patients, the vaccine boosted immunity against some of the selected tumour antigens from the individual patients, and two patients showed infiltration of tumour-reactive T cells. These results suggest that personalized vaccines could be refined and tailored to provide clinical benefit as cancer immunotherapies. Effective anti-tumour immunity in humans has been associated with the presence of T cells directed at cancer neoantigens1, a class of HLA-bound peptides that arise from tumour-specific mutations. They are highly immunogenic because they are not present in normal tissues and hence bypass central thymic tolerance. Although neoantigens were long-envisioned as optimal targets for an anti-tumour immune response2, their systematic discovery and evaluation only became feasible with the recent availability of massively parallel sequencing for detection of all coding mutations within tumours, and of machine learning approaches to reliably predict those mutated peptides with high-affinity binding of autologous human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules. We hypothesized that vaccination with neoantigens can both expand pre-existing neoantigen-specific T-cell populations and induce a broader repertoire of new T-cell specificities in cancer patients, tipping the intra-tumoural balance in favour of enhanced tumour control. Here we demonstrate the feasibility, safety, and immunogenicity of a vaccine that targets up to 20 predicted personal tumour neoantigens. Vaccine-induced polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells targeted 58 (60%) and 15 (16%) of the 97 unique neoantigens used across patients, respectively. These T cells discriminated mutated from wild-type antigens, and in some cases directly recognized autologous tumour. Of six vaccinated patients, four had no recurrence at 25 months after vaccination, while two with recurrent disease were subsequently treated with anti-PD-1 (anti-programmed cell death-1) therapy and experienced complete tumour regression, with expansion of the repertoire of neoantigen-specific T cells. These data provide a strong rationale for further development of this approach, alone and in combination with checkpoint blockade or other immunotherapies.},
