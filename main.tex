\begin{abstract}
Cancer neoantigen vaccines have emerged as a promising approach to stimulate
the immune system to fight cancer. We present a phase plane analysis
of a simple model to understand immunological mechanisms of
cancer neoantigen vaccines. Analytical results are obtained for
two widely used functional forms that represent killing rate of tumor cells by immune cells:
the law of mass action and the dePillis-Radunskaya Law. Using the law
of mass action type killing rate function, our results reveal that a slowly growing tumor can escape the immune surveillance, and that there is a unique periodic solution. The dePillis-Radunskaya Law offers richer dynamics, for which tumor elimination and uncontrolled growth are both present. We show that tumor elimination depends
on the ratio of initial population size of activated T cells to the malignant cell count, which lends support to using cancer vaccine
as an adjuvant therapy after the primary tumor is surgically removed or treated using radiotherapy. We also derive a sufficient condition for uncontrolled tumor growth under the assumption of the dePillis-Radunskaya Law. The juxtaposition of analyses with these two different choices for the killing rate function highlights their importance on model behavior and biological implications, by which we hope to spur further theoretical and experimental work to understand mechanisms underlying different functional forms for the killing rate.

\section{Introduction}

The immune system plays an important role in controlling tumor growth
and preventing or slowing malignant progression \citep{Waldman2020}. Innate and adaptive
immune responses are two immune response types. The immune system may launch these responses when fighting against cancer. Malignant cells express non-synonymous mutations
and produce tumor-specific antigens called neoantigens \citep{Peng2019}.
Neoantigens presented by malignant cells can be recognized by the immune system triggering a cascade of adaptive
immune responses \citep{Zhang2021}, which includes proliferation of T cells
that target the tumor cells associated with the particular antigen.
However, the immune response may not be naturally induced or the response may be insufficient to control tumor growth in some cancer patients \citep{Ward2016}. Immunotherapy aims to boost the human immune system to fight
against cancer. With the advances in genome sequencing, the neoantigen
cancer vaccine, designed to target specifically tumor cells
by recognizing neoantigen, has emerged as a promising treatment. Specifically, the synthetic tumor-specific
peptides or peptide-coding ribonucleic acids are administered into patients to help activate immune cells in this novel therapy. Neoantigen cancer vaccination is highly personalized and has shown its advantage in avoiding auto-immune
side effects \citep{Nelde2021} and achieving desirable clinical outcomes in
treating different cancers
\citep[e.g.][]{Ott2017,Pan2018,Peng2019}. 

The complexity of the immune system and its interactions with tumors
make it challenging to understand their dynamics and design optimal
immunotherapy treatments. Mathematical modeling could be a valuable tool in enhancing our understanding of tumor-immune interactions as shown in many examples from the literature \citep[e.g., see reviews by][and references therein]{Eftimie2016,Mahlbacher2019,Nukala2021}. Mathematical models can encourage hypothesis generation and testing thus help understand biological mechanisms and phenomena better. The
quantitative nature of mathematical models also makes them useful tools in prognostic predictions and optimizing treatments. 

On the topic of modeling immunotherapy or cancer immunology, the use of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is arguably the most popular choice
given their analytical or computational tractability
\citep{Eftimie2010}. Due to complexity of the immune system, the published ODE models for cancer immunology often focus on certain aspects of it. One of the most important
aspects is the interaction between the tumor and the immune system, especially
how the immune system works to kill or control malignant cells. For example, predator-prey equations, which stem from the field of ecology, are often used to model the interaction between tumor cells (the prey) and immune effector cells (the predators) \citep{Hamilton2022}. The tumor growth is an important aspect to model. Many mathematical
models have been developed to study tumor growth, as forms of exponential, logistic and Gompertizian
growth \citep{Murphy2016}. Another important but less studied aspect is the killing of tumor cells
by immune cells. The killing mechanisms have been modeled using
the law of mass action, which became popular after a seminal paper by \citet{KUZNETSOV1994}.
Another choice of a killing function is the so-called dePillis-Radunskaya
Law proposed by \citet{Pillis2005} for its better fits to the mouse and human data. The law of mass action stemming from chemical reactions assumes well-mixed molecules, while the dePillis-Radunskaya
Law is purely phenomenological. Each of the above two choices has its own merits over the other in different circumstances. The dePillis-Radunskaya Law is likely to be a
better choice than the law of mass action when well-mixed
assumption is less applicable. Oftentimes, the data is not sufficient or the biological mechanism is not well understood to help make a choice. The selection usually depends on the preference
of the modeler and is not often adequately justified. The resulting difference in modeled dynamics for choosing one functional form over the other is not
clear. 

In dealing with the increasing complexity of mathematical models and growing
needs to use them to inform decision-making for public health, \citet{Basu2013} urged that sensitivity analysis should
not only be done with parameters but also on alternative model structures. Particularly, we recognize enormous efforts devoted
to modeling cancer immunotherapy with the goal of informing medical treatments
while there is a lack of attention on the choice for some key
model components. The functional form for killing of tumor cells is one of them.

The objective of this paper is to investigate analytically the outcomes
and implications of using the law of mass action versus the dePillis-Radunskaya
Law for the tumor killing rate function in a simple mathematical
model of cancer vaccines. Specifically, we are interested in learning
how the functional form of the killing rate may lead to model outcomes of tumor elimination
or uncontrolled growth (i.e., tumor escapes the immune control). We present
a model of a system of ODEs including three species: neoantigen peptides, activated T cells and tumor cells, inspired by the model published by \citet{Messan2021}. Assuming a quasi-steady state (QSS) approximation for neoantigen peptides, the system is further reduced to a two-dimensional system. Our phase plane analysis and close-form analytical
results from the reduced model offer some possible biological interpretations, which complement
the simulation-based study by \citet{Messan2021}.  \red{To do: add references of phase plane. added in the analysis section}

This paper is organized as follows. In Section \ref{sec:A-simplified-model},
we introduce a simple mathematical model, assumptions and approximations made in this analysis. In Section \ref{sec:data}, preliminary data fitting and exploratory analysis are conducted, which motivate further mathematical analysis of the model. In Section \ref{sec:Analysis-on-two},
we perform analysis of the reduced model to contrast the resulting
difference in dynamics of tumor-immune interaction using the law of mass action versus the dePillis-Radunskaya
Law killings for tumor killing functions. In Section \ref{sec:Discussion}, we discuss the biological
meaning implied by the two different killing functions, the
limitation in the current work and future research directions. 



\section{Model description \label{sec:A-simplified-model}}
We propose a three-species model inspired by the model published by \cite{Messan2021}. The following simplifications are made
\begin{itemize}
\item Activated CD4$^{+}$ and CD8$^{+}$ T cells are lumped into a single species, the activated T cells, and behave the same way biologically;
\item The detailed antigen presenting process by dendritic cells is not considered;
\item The activated T cells are derived from a constant supply of na\"ive cells in presence of neoantigen peptides derived from tumor cells, which is modeled phenomenologically as a function of $P$;
\item The proliferation of T cells is independent of $P$ and can be lumped to the death term.
\end{itemize} 
With the above simplifications, the dynamics of the three species are described by the equations below 
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:3sp-model}
\begin{eqnarray} 
P' & = & D(A,T)T-\delta_{P}P+u(t)\label{eq:P'}\\
A' & = & a(P)-\delta A\label{eq:A'}\\
T' & = & \beta T-mD(A,T)T\label{eq:T'}
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
where $P, A$ and $T$ denote neoantigen peptides,
activated T cells and tumor cells, respectively and the prime ($'$) indicates time derivative $\frac{d}{dt}$ (we will
use this shorthand notation for derivatives henceforth and the independent variable with respect to which the derivatives is taken should be clear in the context). 

In this paper, we focus on the function $D(A,T)$, representing the killing rate of tumor cells by activated T cells. We explore two alternative forms of this killing rate function:
\begin{itemize}
\item the law of mass action type of killing
\begin{equation} 
   D(A,T)=T; \label{eq:mass-action-killing} 
\end{equation}
\item the dePillis-Radunskaya Law 
\begin{equation}
D(A,T)=\frac{(\frac{A}{T})^{n}}{k^{n}+(\frac{A}{T})^{n}} \label{eq:PR law-1} 
\end{equation}
which has a range $(0,1)$. 
\end{itemize}

Dynamics of neoantigen peptides is described by Eq. (\ref{eq:P'}) and it includes three terms: (1) $D(A,T)T$ as neoantigen peptides released as a result of lysis of tumor cells \citep{Konstorum2017}, (2) natural decay of neoantigen peptides $\delta_P P$, and (3) administration of vaccine peptides modeled by time dependent function $u(t)$. We do not specify a multiplying parameter in front of $D(A,T)T$ in
(\ref{eq:P'}) because peptides $P$ is a latent variable in our data set and scaling
can be applied to remove the multiplying parameter without loss of
generality.  

The dynamics of activated T cells is described by Eq. (\ref{eq:A'}). The term $a(P)$ models the activation of na\"ive T cells in the presence of neoantigen peptides, $P$. Acknowledging that neoantigen peptides are processed and presented by antigen presenting dendritic cells to activate T cells and a variety of immune activation (IA) processes are involved in this process; for simplicity, we only model T cell activation phonologically in this work. Our choice of $a(P)$ is a Hill function of the form   
\begin{equation} \label{eq:hill-a(P)}
a(P)=\phi P^{\lambda}/(s^{\lambda}+P^{\lambda}), 
\end{equation}
which is widely used to model upregulation of a certain quantity in response to a stimulus in biology \citep{Somvanshi2013}. In Eq. (\ref{eq:hill-a(P)}), $\phi$ is the maximum production rate of activated T cells, $s$ is the half-saturation constant quantifying the threshold peptide concentration required for 50\% output response, and $\lambda$ is the Hill coefficient that characterizes the sensitivity of the response. The activated T cells are assumed to have a natural decay rate $\delta$.

The dynamics of tumor cells is described by Eq. (\ref{eq:T'}). In absence of activated T cells, tumor cell population, for simplicity, is assumed to grow exponentially with rate $\beta$. Through immunotherapeutic intervention, tumor cells are reduced at a rate of $mD(A,T)$, where $m$ is the maximum killing rate. Recall that the term $D(A,T)T$ also appears in Eq. (\ref{eq:P'}) as neoantigen peptides from lysis of tumor cells. We note that an unbounded solution for tumor cell population may arise due to our choice of exponential growth, which can be clearly interpreted as failure of the treatment. 

\begin{comment} %move to discussion?
The term $D(A,T)T$ appears in both (\ref{eq:P'}) and (\ref{eq:T'}).
In (\ref{eq:T'}), it represents the killing of tumor cells by the
activated T cells. As a result of lysis of tumor cells, neoantigen
peptides are released \citep{Konstorum2017} and hence it appears in
(\ref{eq:P'}) as a production term. It is reasonable to require that
$D(A,T)$ increases with $A$ and decreases with $T$. 
In absence of T cells, the growth of tumor cells is assumed to be exponential
with rate $\beta$ . This is no doubt a simplification. In reality,
tumor cells without interventions may undergo a stage of exponential
growth but exponential growth cannot be sustained because various
constraining factors such as space, oxygen or other immune controls not considered in this work.

In the modeling literature, logistic  \citep[e.g.][]{DePillis2013,Nikolopoulou2018}
and Gompertizian growth \citep[e.g.][]{Norton1988,Castillo2015} 
are popular choices as well as power law growth \citep{Dethlefsen1968}.
There are studies dedicated to comparing different approaches in modeling
tumor growth \citep{Murphy2016}. Despite the popularity of other
choices, it is frequent to find exponential growth being used to model
tumor growth, which has merit in its simplicity. In our formulation,
choosing exponential growth allows us to focus on the effects of different
choices of killing functions. The consequence of unbounded solution of
tumor population $T$ can clearly be interpreted as failure of the
treatment or death of the patient.

In (\ref{eq:A'}), $a(P)$ models the conversion of the na\"ive T cells
to the activated T cells when neoantigen peptides are present, which is
one of the types of immune activation (IA) and the only one considered
in this work. This is a simplification we take being aware of a well
known fact that neoantigen piptides need to be processed and presented
by antigen presenting dendritic cells to activate T cells. It is reasonable
to require that $a(P)$ increases with $P$. We start numerical experiments
in MATLAB R2021a using Hill functions for IA, i.e.

\section{Data fitting and exploratory analysis} \label{sec:data}
We first perform data fitting on the full model (\ref{eq:3sp-model}) with the law of mass action killing (\ref{eq:mass-action-killing}). Patient-specific parameters are estimated by minimizing residual sum of squares (RSS) for each patient's data separately. The data set used here is the same as in \cite{Messan2021}, which consists of activated T cell counts of six patients treated with personalized neoantigen cancer vaccines. Here $\beta, \delta, s$ and $\phi$ are considered to be patient-specific. Due to sparsity of data, especially because $P$ and $T$ are latent variables, it is not surprising to find other parameters unidentifiable.  Since the model lumps many intermediate biological processes and is phenomenological on its construction, it is difficult to find the exact values of those parameters from the literature. We manually set those parameters within order of magnitude based on the hypothesis that change of $P$ is on a much faster time scale than $A$ and $T$. The predicted tumor cell and activated T cell populations through data fitting along with the observed T cell population reported by \cite{Ott2017} are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:data-fitting.}. We find the model fits the data reasonably well. Moreover, the model prediction shows patients 2 and 6 do not respond to the cancer vaccine well, which is in agreement with the observation that these two patients developed metastasis after the initial vaccine regimen \citep{Ott2017}. All estimated model parameters are reported in Table \ref{tab:parameters} as well as RSS values in comparison to that by \cite{Messan2021}. We converted adjusted $R^2$ values reported in \cite{Messan2021} to RSS, which we consider as a better metric for evaluating performance of nonlinear models \citep{Spiess2010}. \red{(RSS to be removed?)}

The dePillis-Radunskaya Law introduces two more parameters. With this extra flexibility, we find it not hard to get qualitatively similar fittings (comparable RSS) to that with the law of mass action killing function. Due to suspected issues of overfitting and parameter unidentifiability, we decide to not present the fittings to avoid misinterpretations on model comparison or selection. A thorough and statistically principled data analysis, e.g., using mixed effect model approach for parameter estimation, is left for future investigation. In this work, we choose to focus on understanding the model dynamics.

During our numerical experiments with using different functional forms for $D(A,T)$, we observed different asymptotic model behaviors (Fig. \ref{fig:tentative}) such that periodic solutions are observed for the system (\ref{eq:3sp-model}) when the law of mass action type killing rate function is used. Also, when using the dePillis-Radunskaya Law, we found tumor elimination was sensitive to initial conditions of the system. These observations spur further mathematical analysis in understanding the model behavior and its biological implications due to different choices of functional form for $D(A,T)$, which is presented in the next section.

\section{Phase plane analysis of the reduced model \label{sec:Analysis-on-two}}
\subsection{Model reduction}
Phase plane analysis is commonly used to study the qualitative behavior of nonlinear planar ODE systems for which analytical solutions are often not tractable \citep[see, e.g.,][Chapter 2]{jordan2007nonlinear}. In order to conduct phase plane analysis, we reduce the system (\ref{eq:3sp-model}) to a two-dimensional system (\ref{eq:2sp}). We assume dynamics of peptides $P$ (molecular level) to be much faster than the dynamics of $A$ and $T$ (cellular level).
This is supported by the parameter values of the full model (\ref{eq:3sp-model}) estimated through fitting to real
patient data (parameters for $A$ and $T$ are generally one order of magnitude smaller than those for $P$; see Table \ref{tab:parameters}). QSS approximation is often applied in such cases by assuming that the fast variable ($P$ in this case) equilibrates instantly to its `quasi-steady state' and thus becomes a function of slow variables ($A$ and $T$ in this case). That is accomplished by setting the right hand side (RHS) of Eq. (\ref{eq:P'}) to zero and solving for $P$ (time-dependent dosing $u(t)$ is assumed to zero in our analysis and dosing is discussed in Section \ref{sec:Discussion}). Proceeding with QSS
approximation for $P$, we conduct analysis in the next sections on
the reduced system below
\begin{subequations} \label{eq:2sp}
\begin{eqnarray}
A' & = & a(P)-\delta A \label{eq:A'-1}\\
T' & = & \beta T-mD(A,T)T \label{eq:T'-1}
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
where $P=D(A,T)T$ in (\ref{eq:A'-1}).

To further simplify our analysis, we approximate the previously defined Hill function (\ref{eq:hill-a(P)}) with 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:heaviside}
a(P)=\phi H(P-s)
\end{equation}
where $H(\cdot)$ is the Heaviside step function (i.e., $H(P-s)=0$ if $P-s<0$
and $H(P-s)=1$ if $P-s\ge0$), which is the limit of the Hill
function (\ref{eq:hill-a(P)}) as $\lambda\to\infty$. Note that $s$ is now a hard activation threshold. Using this approximation further simplifies the analysis. 

On the phase plane, we let horizontal axis
represent $T$ and vertical axis represent $A$. As motivated by (\ref{eq:heaviside}), we call the curve
$D(A,T)T=s$ the T cell activation (IA) curve. Here $s$ can be interpreted as a threshold of $P$ needed for IA. Below this IA curve, the population
of the activated T cells is decreasing (i.e., $A'<0$) and above, the population
of the activated T cells is growing (i.e., $A'>0$, T cell activation surpasses its decay).
Similarly, it is insightful to note that the curve $mD(A,T)T=\beta$
separates the regions of growing or decreasing of tumor cell population. We name
$mD(A,T)T=\beta$ the tumor receding (TR) curve. These intersecting IA and TR curves separate
the phase plane into four regions: 
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{align*} 
\text{\rom{1}} &=  \{(T,A): D(A,T)T<s, D(A,T)>\beta \}; \\ 
\text{\rom{2}} &=  \{(T,A): D(A,T)T<s, D(A,T)<\beta \}; \\ 
\text{\rom{3}} &=  \{(T,A): D(A,T)T>s, D(A,T)<\beta \}; \\ 
\text{\rom{4}} &=  \{(T,A): D(A,T)T>s, D(A,T)>\beta \}. 
\end{align*}
\end{linenomath*}
The general directions of the slope field are summarized in Table \ref{tab:Four-regions}. 

On the curve $D(A,T)T=s$, the RHS of (\ref{eq:A'-1})
is not continuous, which may cause some issues since many classical
ODE theories are based on differentiability of the RHS. Solutions of ODE
with discontinuous RHS can be studied in a rigorous framework proposed
by \citet{Filippov1988}. Filippov's theory is mostly useful
in the understanding of the solution when trajectories collide onto the
discontinuity line. However, this does not happen for our model with
either choice of the killing functions (this can be seen geometrically by looking
at the general direction of the slope field with respect to the IA
curve or algebraically verified by taking dot product of the normal
vector and the slope vector). Similar dilemma also arises when the
initial condition is on the IA curve where the slope fields on the
two sides diverge. Even though it can be resolved as a sliding solution
in the Filippov sense, this additional technicality does not offer more
biological insights. For our
purpose, we simply do not consider any initial conditions on the part of the IA
curve where this can be an issue. Furthermore, if a trajectory later reaches the IA curve, we
can assume that it crosses the curve immediately and the solution
is concatenated from one side and continued on according the RHS on
the other side. On either side of the IA curve, the system has differentiable RHS and
can be analyzed using classical methods as long as the trajectory
stays on one side.

\end{table}

\subsection{Analysis on the two forms of the killing rate function}
\subsubsection{The law of mass action}
In this case, $D(A,T)=A$ and the IA curve is $AT=s$. Above the IA
curve ($AT>s$),
\begin{subequations}
\begin{eqnarray}
A' & = & \phi-dA\\
T' & = & \beta T-mAT, \label{eq:T'-DA-above}
\end{eqnarray}
\label{eq:aboveAC}
\end{subequations}
and below the IA curve ($AT<s$)
\begin{subequations}
\begin{eqnarray}
A' & = & -\delta A\\
T' & = & \beta T-mAT. \label{eq:T'-DA-below}
\end{eqnarray}
\label{eq:belowAC}
\end{subequations}

It is not hard to verify that any trajectory starting in $\Omega \equiv \{(T,A):T>0,0<A<\phi/\delta\}$ stays in $\Omega$ (i.e., $\Omega$ is an invariant set). Also note that $\phi / \delta$ is the maximum level of activated T cell that the immune system can sustain. We focus the following analysis on $\Omega$. Since $A<\phi/\delta$, it follows from Eqs. (\ref{eq:T'-DA-above}) and (\ref{eq:T'-DA-below}) that
for $\beta > \frac{m\phi}{\delta}$, $T\to\infty$,
which means tumor is growing whether the immune system is activated
or not since the growth rate of tumor cells is larger than the maximum killing rate. The more interesting scenario is when $\beta<\frac{m\phi}{\delta}$,
that is, the growth rate of tumor is less than the maximum killing
rate achieved when the activated T cells reach their biological maximum
level. This will be the underlying assumption in the following analysis on the law of mass action type killing rate function. 

Assuming $\beta<\frac{m\phi}{\delta}$, on the phase plane a trajectory starting in Region \rom{3}
enters Region \rom{4}, then enters Region \rom{1}, then enters Region \rom{2} as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:DA-PP-4regions}.
The question is whether the trajectory will enter Region \rom{3} or stays in \rom{2}. If it enters Region \rom{3},
there is likely a periodic solution, which means the tumor recurrence is inevitable; but if the trajectory stays in \rom{2}, we expect an uncontrolled tumor growth. A necessary and sufficient condition for these two cases are derived as follows.

In Region \rom{2}, the system evolves according to (\ref{eq:belowAC}), which
can be solved with initial condition $(T_{0},A_{0})\in\text{\rom{2}}$
exactly leading to 
\begin{eqnarray}
A(t) & = & A_{0}e^{-\delta t}\nonumber \\
T(t) & = & T_{0}\exp(\beta t-\frac{mA_{0}(1-e^{-\delta t})}{\delta})\label{eq:soln belowAC}.
\end{eqnarray}
Thus,
\begin{equation}
AT=A_{0}T_{0}\exp((\beta-\delta)t-\frac{mA_{0}}{\delta}(1-e^{-\delta t})).
\end{equation} 
If $\beta<\delta$, $AT<A_{0}T_{0}<s$ for all $t>0$ and furthermore
we have uncontrolled tumor growth $T\to\infty$, while the population of activated T cells is reduced critically (i.e., $A\to0$) as $t\to\infty$. This phenomenon that a small tumor manage to grow to a large size under the radar of immune surveillance is sometimes colloquially called `sneaking through' \citep{KUZNETSOV1994}.  \cite{George2018} reported sneaking through of a slow growing tumor, which is also observed in our
model. A trajectory representing a tumor sneaking through on the phase
plane is shown in the right panel of Fig. \ref{fig:PP-DA}. 

If $\beta>\delta$, the trajectory starting in Region \rom{2} reaches the IA curve 
and enters Region \rom{3}. \iffalse (to do: exists (invisible) tangential point $A_{2}^{*}=(\beta-\delta)/m$
for any $A_{0}T_{0}=s$ and $A_{0}<A^{*}$ immediately enters Region \rom{3};
). \fi Thus, there is a possibility of a periodic solution (limit cycle). Consider
the Poincare section $\{(T,A):AT=s,\,\beta/m<A<\phi/\delta \}$, i.e., the part of the IA curve with the end points being 
the intersections with TR curve $A=\beta/m$ \iffalse (to do: or
more precisely need to consider the tangential point $A_{4}^{*}$) \fi
and the line $A=\phi / \delta$ (maximum level of active T cells).
Note that any trajectory starting from this section traverses through Regions \rom{1}, \rom{2}, \rom{3} and \rom{4} and must
return to this section. It follows that there is
a fixed point by the fixed point theorem, which is equivalent to the existence of a periodic solution. 

Concerning the periodic solution of the system (\ref{eq:aboveAC}) and (\ref{eq:belowAC}), we can further show its uniqueness by explicit calculation. We state it as a theorem below.  
\begin{theorem} \label{thm:unique}
There is a unique periodic solution of the system (\ref{eq:aboveAC}) and (\ref{eq:belowAC})
\end{theorem}
 The detailed proof is included in the appendix, in which we discover that the uniqueness of the periodic solution is equivalent to the uniqueness of solution to Eq. (\ref{eq:t1-period}). Moreover, Eq. (\ref{eq:t1-period}) can be readily
solved numerically to give the length of a period given parameters
as shown in Fig. (\ref{fig:Contour-plot-of-period}). It is interesting
to notice that the period is independent from the threshold $s$.
It may just be a mathematical consequence and not bear any biological
meaning. 

The simple form of the mass action type of killing makes it possible to deduce a necessary and sufficient condition ($\beta<\delta$) for uncontrolled tumor growth by explicit calculation. In the next subsection, we will analyze the dePillis-Radunskaya Law, which appears to be more complicated but nevertheless offers richer dynamics.

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{The dePillis-Radunskaya Law}
In this section, we analyze the system (\ref{eq:2sp}) with $D(A,T)$
defined as in  (\ref{eq:PR law-1}). Note that (\ref{eq:PR law-1}) is a Hill
function of the ratio $A/T$, in which $n$ describes how fast per capita
killing rate turns on as the ratio of activated T cells versus tumor cells increases.
The implications of $n$ on uncontrolled tumor growth will be derived later in this section.
First, we note that the four regions and general direction of the vector field are same as before (Table \ref{tab:Four-regions}). But the shape of IA and TR curves are different. As in the previous section, we focus on the
invariant set $\Omega=\{(T,A):T>0,0<A<\phi/d\}$. We assume $\beta<m$, i.e.,
the growth rate of tumor is smaller than the maximum killing rate.
Otherwise, the tumor grows exponentially regardless of immune control.
Even though we still have simple analytical solution of $A$, analytical
solutions of $T$ are not tractable. We seek a sufficient condition
of uncontrolled tumor growth if the initial condition is in Region \rom{2}. 

 The IA curve for dePillis-Radunskaya Law is
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{1}{s}A^{n}T & = & k^{n}T^{n}+A^{n}\label{eq:IA-dP}
\end{eqnarray}
which has an asymptote $T=1/s$. Consider here $n>1$. \iffalse (to do: $n=1$?) \fi
By implicit differentiation of (\ref{eq:IA-dP}), it can be found
that the IA curve achieves a minimum at $T=\frac{n}{n-1}s$, at which
$A=ks(n-1)^{1/n}\frac{n}{n-1}$. Moreover, the TR curve
$\beta=mD(A,T)$ is now a line pass the origin with slope 
\begin{linenomath*}
\[
\frac{k}{(m/\beta-1)^{1/n}}.
\]
\end{linenomath*}
There is a unique intersection ($T=\frac{sm}{\beta}$) between the
TR line and the IA curve in the invariant set $\Omega$ if 
\begin{eqnarray}
s & < & \frac{\beta}{m}\frac{\phi}{k\delta}(\frac{m}{\beta}-1)^{1/n},\label{eq:s<}
\end{eqnarray}
  otherwise, Region \rom{3} does not exist and the tumor population $T$ grows
without bound for any initial condition in Region \rom{2}. 

Suppose the interaction of the IA and TR curves exists in $\Omega$. We can derive
a sufficient condition for uncontrolled tumor growth. If the intersection
is on the right to the minimum of the IA curve, then the minimum is above the line
and hence any trajectory starting in Region \rom{2} cannot cross the IA curve
since $A$ is monotonically decreasing. Thus the sufficient condition
of uncontrolled tumor growth is 
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
\frac{m}{\beta}>\frac{n}{n-1}.\label{eq:sneak-thru-cond}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
Since we have assumed $m>\beta$, this condition is satisfied for sufficient large $n$. In this sense, a faster switch in the dePillis-Radunskaya
Law favors uncontrolled tumor growth. Since $n$ also controls the tail of the Hill function, a better  interpretation may be that
not enough killing at the low $A/T$ tail favors uncontrolled tumor growth. 

Now consider a trajectory started in Region \rom{1} with $A(0)>\frac{n}{n-1}s$ (this extra constraint on the initial condition precludes the "pathological" case in which the trajectory goes to Region \rom{4}),
Note that in Region \rom{1} both $A'<0$ and $T'<0$. We want to study whether we have $T\to0$ and under which conditions this occurs. Since (\ref{eq:PR law-1}) is not defined at $A=T=0$, we consider
a transformation $x=A/T$, which gives  
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{eqnarray}
x' & = & x(-\delta-\beta+\frac{mx^{n}}{k^{n}+x^{n}})\label{eq:x' for dP}\\
 & = & \frac{x}{k^{n}+x^{n}}((m-\delta-\beta)x^{n}-(\delta+\beta)k^{n}).\nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
\end{linenomath*}
Note that for $m\le\delta+\beta$, $x'<0$ and there exists $\tau$
such that $x(\tau)=\frac{k}{(m/\beta-1)^{1/n}}$ for any $x(0)>\frac{k}{(m/\beta-1)^{1/n}}$.
Thus, the trajectory must enter Region \rom{2}. For $m>\delta+\beta$, it can
be shown that 
\begin{linenomath*}
\[
x_{1}^{*}=\frac{k}{(m/(\delta+\beta)-1)^{1/n}}
\]
\end{linenomath*}
 is an unstable fixed point of (\ref{eq:x' for dP}). Also note that
$x_{1}^{*}>\frac{k}{(m/\beta-1)^{1/n}}$ , the slope of $\beta=mD(A,T)$.
If $x(0)<x_{1}^{*}$, $x\to0$, in which case the trajectory enters
Region \rom{2}. If $x(0)>x_{1}^{*},x\to\infty$, then the trajectory
will not cross the line $\beta=mD(A,T)$ to enter Region \rom{2} and $T\to0$
faster than $A$ does. This is the case when the tumor is eliminated.
The line $A=x_{1}^{*}T$ is the separatrix that divides these two cases
as depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:dP-PP-sep}. In contrast with the law
of mass action killing, the tumor can be completely eliminated under the
dePillis-Radunskaya Law as long as the maximum killing is large enough
and the starting point is favorable, i.e. the tumor is not too large
compared to the active T cell population. 

Now we consider trajectories starting in Region \rom{3}.  \iffalse (can show no pseudo-equilibrium;
tangent points are invisible? see Appendix) \fi The conditions that are both sufficient and necessary for characterizing the destination of a trajectory are elusive.
Instead, we seek for sufficient conditions. Let the initial condition $A(0)=A_0$ and $T(0)=T_0$.
With $x=A/T$, 
\begin{eqnarray*}
x' & = & x(\frac{\phi}{A}-\delta-\beta+\frac{mx^{n}}{k^{n}+x^{n}})\\
A' & = & \phi-\delta A.
\end{eqnarray*}
Since $A$ is monotonically increasing,
\begin{eqnarray*}
x' & \le & x(\frac{\phi}{A_{0}}-\delta-\beta+\frac{mx^{n}}{k^{n}+x^{n}})\\
   & = & \frac{x}{k^{n}+x^{n}}((m+\frac{\phi}{A_{0}}-\delta-\beta)x^{n}-(\delta+\beta-\frac{\phi}{A_{0}})k^{n}).
\end{eqnarray*}
There are two conditions can be deduced from the above inequality, either of which is sufficient for the trajectory
to enter Region \rom{2}: One is $\delta+\beta-\frac{\phi}{A_{0}}>m$; For $0<\delta+\beta-\frac{\phi}{A_{0}}<m$,
$x_{3}^{*}=k(\frac{\delta+\beta-\phi/A_{0}}{m+\phi/A_{0}-\delta-\beta})^{1/n}$ is an unstable fixed point. Thus for a trajectory starting in Region \rom{3} with $A_0/T_0<x_{3}^{*}$,
it enters Region \rom{2}. A third sufficient condition can be deduced from the phase plane (Fig. \ref{fig:dP-PP-4regions}), if $T_0>\frac{\phi}{\delta k}(\frac{m}{\beta}-1)^{1/n}$, the trajectory must enter Region \rom{2}. 

Also note that given $A_0$, $T_0$ can be chosen to make the initial point sufficiently close to the TR line so that the trajectory then crosses the line $\beta=mD(A,T)$
to enter Region \rom{4}. Moreover, once in Region \rom{4} this trajectory continues to enter Region \rom{1}. In fact, any trajectory starting in Region \rom{4} enters Region \rom{1}. 

We have gained biologically interpretable results by analyzing the system (\ref{eq:2sp}) with the dePillis-Radunskaya Law (\ref{eq:PR law-1}) region by region.  Of particular interests is that tumor elimination is possible, which is absent when using the mass action type killing functional form. The dependence of tumor elimination on the initial condition may have medical significance. We stop here and remark that an explicit global condition for this system is likely to be complicated if achievable. Further biological interpretation of our findings will be discussed in the next section.

\section{Discussion\label{sec:Discussion}}
To understand tumor-immune system interactions, we introduce a simple model (\ref{eq:3sp-model}) inspired by the one proposed by \citet{Messan2021}. We invoke QSS approximation to reduce it to a 2-dimensional system (\ref{eq:2sp}) so that we can investigate two common functional forms for the killing rate function $D(A,T)$ using phase plane analysis. On the phase plane, there are two important curves that separate the phase plane into four regions where the system evolves distinctively. Simple geometrical arguments based on this categorization and some basic
calculations lead to meaningful characterization of the model behavior.
The analytical results facilitate interpretation of the tumor
progression or elimination as a consequence of the mechanisms assumed by the model.
Particularly, for the law of mass action killing, we derived
that a necessary and sufficient condition
for uncontrolled tumor growth is when the tumor growth rate is slower than the
decaying rate of active T cells, i.e., $\beta<\delta$. This phenomenon is known as 'sneaking-through' in which slowly growing immunogenic tumors evade a potentially effective immune response \citet{bocharov2004underwhelming}. In the stochastic model proposed by \cite{George2018}, in which immune evasion mechanism was used as a dynamic threat to study tumor progression, it was also found that sneaking-through behavior results from evasion behavior under small tumor growth rate. Tumor `sneaking through' has been heavily studied theoretically
and experimentally \citep[see e.g.][for a review]{Wilkie2013}. 
 Our model is based on the hypothesis that without medical intervention neoantigen peptides released by lysis of the tumor cells are the only signal that triggers immune response, and the tumor is likely evolving below the IA curve since the signal is weak. Cancer neoantigen vaccines may enhance the signal and trigger stronger immune response and thus provide an effective treatment for `sneaking through' tumors.   

In comparison to the law of mass action killing, the dePillis-Radunskaya
Law offers richer dynamics, nevertheless with a more challenging analysis. The
dePillis-Radunskaya Law is essentially a ratio-dependent Hill function.
Ratio-dependent functional responses have been the focus of plenty
of analytical work in the context of ecology \citep{Abrams2000,Hsu2001,Hsu2003}, but to a much lesser extent in cancer
immunology modeling. This work is a step to fill this gap. In approximating
the Hill function in activation of T cells as a hard switch, we are
able to focus on the switching speed of the Hill function employed
in the dePillis-Radunskaya Law. A salient sufficient condition (\ref{eq:sneak-thru-cond}) for
uncontrolled tumor growth is directly related to the Hill coeffcient $n$ in (\ref{eq:PR law-1}), which states that large $n$ enables
uncontrolled tumor growth. It may be better to interpret this result as not
enough killing at low $A/T$ tail makes uncontrolled growth possible.
In contrast to the law of mass action killing for which asymptotic
result does not depend on initial condition, under the dePillis-Radunskaya
Law, tumor elimination is possible and may depend on the initial
condition. The dependence of tumor elimination on the initial condition may inform the necessity of medical intervention to get
the patient into the favorable initial condition that may lead to
a cure. This finding supports the common medical practice
that uses cancer vaccine as an adjuvant therapy after the primary
tumor is reduced by surgery or radiotherapy.

In addition to QSS approximiation, a further simplification is taken by approximating the Hill function representing activation of T cells in the presence of neoantigen
peptides with the unit step function. This approximation
is frequently used in analyzing models of gene regulatory network
 \citep[e.g.,][]{Glass1973,Mestl1995}. On one hand, \citet{Polynikis2009} cautions in using this approximation by showing discrepancy in the existence and stability of equilibria between the approximated system and its corresponding full system for some cases. On the other hand, in modeling tumor growth, it has been used to model activation of tumor angiogenesis factor production as a function of tumor vasculature \citep{Stamper2007}, where the authors reported that the qualitative behavior was unchanged by it.

The choice of making peptides $P$ as the QSS variable is justified
by the estimated parameter values and the belief that its dynamics on the molecular
level is faster than dynamics on the cellular level on which $A$
and $T$ operate. However, it is a key component as dosage of cancer
vaccine is modeled as a time-dependent source term in (\ref{eq:P'}).
Treating $P$ as a QSS variable makes it impossible to study dosing
explicitly in our reduced model. Nevertheless, it should be noted
that continuous dosing, i.e., constant $u(t)$, is equivalent to a
change to the threshold parameter $s$. Specifically, increasing the
constant dose is equivalent to lowering the threshold $s$ and vice versa. In characterizing the model behavior, $s$ seemingly does not
play a role in most of the results we derived. But likely it is expected
to be important biologically. First, we point out that it is indeed
an important parameter in deciding if the IA and TR curves have an
intersection when the the dePillis-Radunskaya Law is used. As higher
dosage favors the inequality (\ref{eq:s<}), it assists in taking
tumor back to control (crossing the TR line from below). Furthermore,
even though $s$ does not appear in the conditions for asymptotic
results, it is an important control parameter in determining the size
of tumor in the periodic solution or a transient solution to elimination.
The existence of a periodic solution as seen in the reduced model
is also found in the full model, but numerical experiment shows its
period differs in a large amount from the reduced model. That being
said, we recognize the undesirable limitation of the current QSS
approximation in studying dosing strategy as well as its effects on
the quantities that is of medical interests in comparison to the full
model (\ref{eq:3sp-model}). It is left to a future study to investigate and
overcome these issues. 



\section*{Appendix}
\subsection*{Proof of Theorem \ref{thm:unique}}
Suppose there is a periodic solution. Without loss of generality,
we assume at time $t=0$, the solution is at $(A_{0},T_{0})$ on the
IA curve where $A_{0}\in(\beta/m,\phi/\delta)$ and $A_{0}T_{0}=s$.
This periodic solution later intersects with the IA curve at $(A_{1},T_{1})$
at time $t=t_{1}$ and $(A_{2},T_{2})$ at time $t=t_{2}$. We require
$A_{2}=A_{0},T_{2}=T_{0}$ since it is periodic. We already solved
the equation below the IA curve (\ref{eq:soln belowAC}). From $A_{1}T_{1}=A_{0}T_{0}$, we
have an implicit equation for $t_{1}$ and $A_{0}$
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
(\beta-\delta)t_{1}=\frac{mA_{0}}{\delta}(1-e^{-\delta t_{1}})\label{eq:A1T1=00003DA0T0}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
which can be shown to have a unique positive solution $t_{1}$ given $A_{0}\in(\beta/m,\phi/\delta)$ by inspecting the slope and monotonicity of both sides of the equation. 

Above the activation curve we have the solution 
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{eqnarray*}
A & = & \frac{\phi}{\delta}-(\frac{\phi}{\delta}-A_{1})e^{-\delta t}\\
T & = & T_{1}\exp((\beta-\frac{m\phi}{\delta})t+\frac{m}{\delta}(\frac{\phi}{\delta}-A_{1})(1-e^{-\delta t})).
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{linenomath*}
From $A_{2}=A_{0}$, we have 
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
e^{\delta t_{2}}(\frac{\phi}{\delta}-A_{0})=\frac{\phi}{\delta}-A_{0}e^{-\delta t_{1}}.\label{eq:A2=00003DA0}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
From $T_{2}=T_{0}$, we have
\begin{linenomath*} 
\begin{equation}
(\beta-\frac{m\phi}{\delta})t_{2}+\frac{m}{\delta}(\frac{\phi}{\delta}-A_{1})(1-e^{-\delta t_{2}})+\beta t_{1}-\frac{m}{\delta}A_{0}(1-e^{-\delta t_{1}})=0\label{eq:T2=00003DT0}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $A_{1}=A_{0}e^{-\delta t_{1}}$. We have three nonlinear equations (\ref{eq:A1T1=00003DA0T0}),
(\ref{eq:A2=00003DA0}) and (\ref{eq:T2=00003DT0}) for three unkowns
$t_{1},t_{2}$ and $A_{0}$. In general, there is no guarantee of existence
of an unique solution. For this specific case, however, we can first
eliminate the exponentials $e^{-\delta t_{1}}$ and $e^{-\delta t_{2}}$,
which gives 
\begin{linenomath*}
\[
\frac{t_{2}}{t_{1}}=\frac{\beta\delta}{m\phi-\beta\delta}.
\]
\end{linenomath*}
Let $\gamma=\frac{\beta\delta}{m\phi-\beta\delta}$. Note that $\gamma>0$
from the previous assumptions. So we can eliminate $A_{0}$ and $t_{2}$
and reach an equation for $t_{1}$
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
\frac{(e^{\gamma t_{1}}-1)(1-e^{-t_{1}})}{e^{\gamma t_{1}}-e^{-t_{1}}}=\frac{\beta-\delta}{m\phi/\delta^{2}}t_{1}\label{eq:t1-period}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
which can be shown to have an unique solution. Let 
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
f(t_{1})=\frac{(e^{\gamma t_{1}}-1)(1-e^{-t_{1}})}{e^{\gamma t_{1}}-e^{-t_{1}}}.\label{eq:f(t1)}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
It can be shown that $f'(t)>0$ and $f''(t)<0$ for all $t>0$ (see
details of calculation in the appendix), and $\lim_{t\to0}f'(t)=\frac{\beta}{m\phi/\delta^{2}}>\frac{\beta-\delta}{m\phi/\delta^{2}}$.
Moreover, $\lim_{t\to\infty}f(t)=1$. It follows that the periodic
solution is unique.


\subsection*{Proof of $f'(t)>0$ and $f''(t)>0$ }

Let $x=e^{t_{1}}$. Note that $x>1$. 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{df}{dx} & = & \frac{x^{1+\gamma}(-2(1+\gamma)+\gamma x+\frac{\gamma}{x}+x^{\gamma}+\frac{1}{x^{\gamma}})}{(x^{1+\gamma}-1)^{2}}>0\\
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{multline*}
\frac{d^{2}f}{dx^{2}}  =   x^{\gamma-2}\bigg(  -2x^{2}(x^{\gamma}-1)^{2}-\gamma^{2}(x-1)^{2}(x^{1+\gamma}+1)\\-\gamma(x-1)(1+3x-5x^{1+\gamma}+x^{2+\gamma}) \bigg)  \biggm/ (x^{1+\gamma}-1)^{3}
\end{multline*}
we will focus the part of the numerator inside the parenthesis. 
\begin{align*}
 & -2x^{2}(x^{\gamma}-1)^{2}-\gamma^{2}(x-1)^{2}(x^{1+\gamma}+1)-\gamma(x-1)(1+3x-5x^{1+\gamma}+x^{2+\gamma})\\
\le & -2\sqrt{2}x(x^{\gamma}-1)\gamma(x-1)\sqrt{x^{1+\gamma}+1}-\gamma(x-1)(1+3x-5x^{1+\gamma}+x^{2+\gamma})\\
= & -\gamma(x-1)(2\sqrt{2}x(x^{\gamma}-1)\sqrt{x^{1+\gamma}+1}+1+3x-5x^{1+\gamma}+x^{2+\gamma}\\
\le & -\gamma(x-1)(1-x-x^{1+\gamma}+x^{2+\gamma})\\
< & 0
\end{align*}
where we used the fact $-a^{2}-b^{2}<-2ab$ and $x>1$. 

\subsection*{no pseudo-equilibrium for dePillis-Radunskaya Law (work in progress)}

The IA curve $D(A,T)T=s$ has its normal vector $\mathbf{n}=(\frac{\partial D}{\partial T}T+D,\frac{\partial D}{\partial A}T)$
pointing into the region $D(A,T)T>s$, where $T\frac{\partial D}{\partial A}>0$
and $\frac{\partial D}{\partial T}T+D$ changes its sign at $T=\frac{n}{n-1}s$,
i.e. $\frac{\partial D}{\partial T}T+D$\textgreater 0 for $T\in(s,\frac{n}{n-1}s)$
. Above the IA, we have slope field $\mathbf{v}^{+}=(T(\beta-mD),\phi-dA).$
Below the IA, we have the slope field $\mathbf{v}^{-}=(T(\beta-mD),-dA).$
Thus $\mathbf{v}^{+}\cdot\mathbf{n}=\mathbf{v}^{-}\cdot\mathbf{n}+\phi T\frac{\partial D}{A}$.
It follows that $|\mathbf{v}^{+}\cdot\mathbf{n}|+|\mathbf{v}^{-}\cdot\mathbf{n}|\ne0$
(cannot be zero at the same time). Moreover, if $\mathbf{v}^{+}\cdot\mathbf{n}=0$,
$\mathbf{v}^{-}\cdot\mathbf{n}<0$; if $\mathbf{v}^{-}\cdot\mathbf{n}=0$,
$\mathbf{v}^{-}\cdot\mathbf{n}>0$.

\subsection*{unique tangential point}
To do: move the part below to appendix? 

There is a unique tangential point $A_{4}^{*}$ in R4. Let $x=AT$,
we have $x'=x(\frac{\phi}{A}-mA+\beta-\delta)$. Consider the polynomial
$p(A)=-mA^{2}+(\beta-\delta)A+\phi$, which has exactly one positive
root $A_{4}^{*}$. Trajectory leaves R4 if $A>A_{4}^{*}$. Note that
$A_{4}^{*}>\beta/m$ by verifying that $p(\beta/m)>0$. There is also
a unique tangential point $A_{2}^{*}$ in R2 if $\beta>\delta$. Again
let $x=AT$. We have $x'=x(\beta-\delta-mA)$. It follows that $A_{2}^{*}=\frac{\beta-\delta}{m}$.
